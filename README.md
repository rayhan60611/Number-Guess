# Number Guessing Game Using Python

Number Guessing is one of the famous game played by many people. It is a game in which the player randomly think of any number in his/her mind then follow the instruction after that input the number to the computer from the number that he thought earlier but not the full number just omiting a single bit/digit from it ,then finally the computer will give you the missing bit/digit from the number. So we are going to implement this game using python. 

## This python project is to build a game for a single player that plays with the computer.

### Following are the rules of the game:

1. First you have to think of a number.
**Step 1:** 
> Let's Assume the main numberis 1234 
2. Then Add the individuals digit and make a sum of it.
**Step 2:**
> 1+2+3+4 = 10
3. Now do a subtraction between main number and the **Step 2:** result.
**Step 3:**
> 1234-10=1224
4. In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.
**Step 4:**
> Now you will get a final result like **1224** & from it you can omit any digit from it & give the rest digit as a input to the computer & then the computer will tell you the **missing** digit.
5. If you want to exit the game then press **E** or **e**.


**N.B:** You must think of a number which has more than 1 digit.
